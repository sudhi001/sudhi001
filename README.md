My expertise includes strong analytical abilities and a clear understanding of Java coding standards, design patterns, software development life cycle, architectural design, and other aspects of Agile software development.

In addition, I possess strong leadership skills, as demonstrated by my ability to manage multiple responsibilities in a fast-paced environment with critical deadlines. I am equally comfortable working independently or collaboratively in a team setting, and I have a proven ability to think outside the box in identifying problems and implementing innovative solutions.

My experience extends to building backend APIs with Spring Frameworks, Flask, Node.js, and other tools. I have also developed client-side applications for major platforms like iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows. I have extensive experience in client-side security and code evaluation, and I am well-versed in working with major client-side and server-side databases such as Mongo, MySQL, Oracle, PGSQL, Realm, SQLite, and Hive.

I am committed to integrating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes to ensure more productive work. I also have experience in REST API performance analysis and have developed Struts UI components. Most of my projects have followed the Test-Driven Development (TDD) architecture, and I have 5+ years of experience in developing Tele Health applications with HIPPA Complaints compliance.

I am a passionate tech enthusiast and skilled programmer with a deep interest in the latest trends and technologies in the field. I have a strong background in software development and am always eager to learn new techniques and tools that can help me develop innovative solutions to complex problems.

I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in programming languages, frameworks, and platforms, and I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am particularly interested in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

As a programmer, I am committed to delivering high-quality code that meets the needs of my clients and users. I am comfortable working with a range of programming languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++, and I have experience developing applications for a variety of platforms, including desktop, web, mobile, and embedded systems.
